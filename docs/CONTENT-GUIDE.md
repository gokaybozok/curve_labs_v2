# Content Guide

This document provides guidelines for creating and managing content for the Lab Derivative site.

## Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored in `content/posts/` as Markdown files.

### Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

Example: `2024-03-15-introduction-to-lace.md`

### Front Matter

Each post should include YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-03-15
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["AI", "Knowledge Management"]
excerpt: "A brief description of the post..."
---
```

### Content Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where relevant
- Add images to `content/images/` and reference them relatively
- Keep paragraphs short for readability

## Images

- Store images in `content/images/`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images for web before adding

*TODO: Expand this guide as content features are implemented.*
